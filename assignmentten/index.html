      <h1>Projected Stats and Advanced Analytics in Baseball</h1>

      </html>
      As long as there’s been baseball, hitters have complained about crushing balls directly at fielders, and pitchers have complained about softly hit balls that dropped in front of fielders. For the hundred-some-odd years of Major League Baseball, these complaints would fall upon deaf ears, with no way to quantify these inconsistencies. That all changed in 2015 with the introduction of Statcast, a state-of-the-art tracking technology that allows for the collection and analysis of a massive amount of baseball data. Statcast is tracking and quantifying much of the action on the field. “That applies to pitching (velocity, spin rate, direction, movement), hitting (exit velocity, launch angle, batted ball distance), running (sprint speed, base-to-base times), and fielding (arm strength, catch probability, catcher pop time). While those numbers are collected on a play-by-play level, they also become the basis for stats that measure players across seasons, such as hard-hit rate for batters or Outs Above Average for fielders.” Statcast revolutionized the way that analysts and statheads looked at baseball statistics. Now instead of just guessing what the outcome of a play could have been there was multiple projections that could tell you.
<p>These advanced statistics lead to better projections and can tell you the “expected” result of every play that has happened. Expected stats allow us to satisfy our suspicion that someone’s notably been robbed or gifted. Teams use them in many different ways, to aid their players in making adjustments and scout future opponents. But it isn't just teams using this information, writers and broadcasters use these advanced analytics to provide viewers with better insight into the game.  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">One great example of how one particular player can get unlucky is Baltimore Orioles first baseman Ryan O’Hearn. I spoke with Ben Lindbergh Senior Editor for the Ringer and host of Effectively Wild Podcast about it. Ben has worked in baseball analytics all his life and has a true passion for the game, “A few hours ago, someone asked me whether the Orioles’ Ryan O’Hearn has hit an unusual number of batted balls that became long, loud outs this year. Thanks to Statcast, I didn’t have to watch every batted ball to answer the question: He has, and as a result, his expected stats are even more robust than the ones based on outcomes only.” Statcast expects O’Hearn’s 2024 batting average to be nearly .100 points higher than it is right now. This is mirrored by his slugging percentage .254 lower and his WOBA .101 points lower. These are three of the stats used very commonly to gauge how well a hitter is playing. These stats show that baseball at the end of the day does still have an element of luck. O’Hearn is doing everything right, he is just, unfortunately, hitting the ball toward a fielder every time. The statistics show that in the long run over the course of the season, O’Hearn’s luck will change and his end-of-year statistics will be closer to the ones he deserves.</p>

</p> Ryan O’Hearn is an extreme example where there is a large discrepancy between his expected and real stats. But with a larger sample size of 100 players over a full 162-game season. As you can see when you take a much larger sample size the results will begin to even out and the expected stats end up very near the true results. So this raises the question do expected values only really matter in the moment for a single-play or single-player outcome? Lindbergh thinks that for a single player, it may not even out over a full season, “There’s a longstanding belief that this luck evens out, but it doesn’t, exactly—not over a single season, at least”. So these stats should be used to assess how a single player has been lucky or unlucky over a year, when put into a larger sample size the data become less relevant. Even knowing that the analytics predicts don’t make the players feel any better, here is Ben Lindbergh one last time, “I don’t know if that makes O’Hearn feel any better, but it should make fans feel good that these imbalances can be quantified—and, by extension, that we can separate process from results, anticipate regression, and evaluate player performance better than before.”
